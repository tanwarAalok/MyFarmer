                <h3>Step 1: Get Organic Certification</h3>
                <p>
                  Getting the certification is one of the important steps in
                  starting organic farming. If you don’t have your land, you can
                  always take the land on lease or buy it if your budget permits
                  for organic farming.

                <h3>Step 2: Selecting Site for Organic Farming</h3>
                <p>
                  The location of the venture plays an imperative part in any
                  venture to be successful. The area of your organic farming in
                  India decides how the endeavor will turn out. The organic
                  farming site ought to be close to a clean water source that
                  means water is the most important asset for crop development
                  and health.<br></br>
                  In case, your water source is far away, it is significantly
                  harder to deal with the irrigation measures in organic
                  farming. As an initiation, this might seem to be a monotonous
                  thought to make but on the other hand, is necessary for
                  effective working on your farm. The closeness of the organic
                  farming area to the commercial center adds the main function
                  to the manageability of the farm. The organic farm’s closeness
                  to the market includes easy communication for selling. Also,
                  this helps spare costs while shipping materials to the farm.
                  <br></br>
                  The site plays a main role for any venture to be successful.
                  An organic farm’s location determines how the venture will
                  turn out. Make sure the farm’s closeness to the market allows
                  for the easy transport of products for selling. Also, this
                  mainly helps save costs when transporting materials to the
                  farm. If the organic farm is not for a commercial purpose, the
                  role of the above-mentioned factors will potentially decrease
                  and the purpose of the organic farm also determines its size.

                <h3>Step 3: Prepare the soil and make good compost</h3>
                <p>
                  Soil is mainly considered to be the foundation base of your
                  organic farming. Carefully starting from its appearance,
                  well-being, and equalization everything is responsible for the
                  production result. So, it essentially becomes important to get
                  when and how to develop your soil and make the most ideal
                  condition for harvests to endure and flourish.<br></br>
                  Organic farming needs healthy soils to provide your plants
                  with all the adequate nutrients they need to grow healthy. All
                  good organic farm produce starts with good soil for plant
                  growth. Inorganic soil treatments potentially harm the
                  environment, the crops that grow in the soil, as well as the
                  consumers who eventually eat the food. Good soil is a mixture
                  of compost, leaf and grass clippings, and manure, and also
                  other vital compositions. Generally, farmers benefit when they
                  make their compost onsite. It is very easy to make and saves a
                  lot of money. Compost mainly helps conserve water, cut down on
                  weeds, and keep wastes out. This step is crucial when one
                  starts organic farming.

                <h3>Step 4: Select suitable crop </h3>
                <p>
                  Only a few crops can be cultivated through organic farming,
                  practicing organic farming results in fewer yields, it is
                  difficult to manage pests and diseases without chemical spray.
                  We can also grow any crop organically. However, it is always
                  advisable to grow the crop based on geographical, soil, and
                  environmental condition. Look around and then observe what
                  other farmers are growing. Keep a note on market prices
                  regularly and choose the commodity which fetches a good price
                  and you can have good profit at the end of the season.
                  <br></br>
                  Knowing about the weather conditions in your area and which
                  crops can thrive in those climatic conditions are essential to
                  selecting the right product. Multiple necessary factors need
                  to be considered before making this decision. These are;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 5: Start looking for Markets</h3>
                <p>
                  If you have grown organic crops at your farm and you don’t
                  know where to sell them after harvesting then you will be in
                  big trouble. Not all wholesalers need organically grown crops.
                  Therefore, once you think about practicing organic farming,
                  you must have a clear idea of who will be the buyer. In which
                  market you will sell your organic product. Once have some sort
                  of idea on this front then it will be easy for you to sell the
                  product after harvesting.

                <h3>Step 6: Take care of what you plant</h3>
                <p>
                  Organic farming takes time and needs more attention compared
                  to conventional farming. Certain methods need to be considered
                  depending on the plant and farm conditions. Also, the organic
                  farming method could not necessarily work for all plants on
                  the farm.
                </p>
              </li>

                <h3>Step 7: Water Management for Organic Farming</h3>
                <p>
                  Water is important for plant’s growth and health. For crops
                  growth, regular watering is necessary. Generally, plants are
                  watered 2 to 3 times a day depending on their type. Watering
                  the plant in the morning is helpful as mornings are cool.
                  Weeding is another important maintenance task in organic
                  farming.<br></br>
                  Pollution of groundwater courses with synthetic fertilizers
                  and pesticides is the main problem in many agriculture areas.
                  They are replaced by organic fertilizers through the use of
                  greater biodiversity in terms of species cultivated. Reduce
                  the risk of groundwater pollution by well-managed organic
                  systems with better nutrient retentive abilities. Conversion
                  to organic farming is highly encouraged as a restorative
                  measure in some areas where pollution is a real problem.
